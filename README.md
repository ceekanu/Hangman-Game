# Hangman-Game
This is my first GitHub project. It is a simple Hangman game implemented using Python. The game lets you guess letters to uncover a hidden word, and you have a limited number of wrong guesses before the game is over.

# Features
Choose from a theme.
Get feedback on incorrect or repeated inputs.
Limited number of attempts to guess the word.
Playable in the terminal.

# Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-game.git
Navigate into the project directory:
cd hangman-game

# Usage
To play the game, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
python hangman.py

# How It Works
You choose a theme from a list of predetermined themes.
The game picks a word at random from a predefined list.
You can enter a letter to try to guess the word.
You have a limited number of incorrect guesses (usually 3 more than the length of the word).
After each guess the letter will display in each spot (if repeated) if correct,or nothing will display if incorrect.
The number of lives you have after each attempt will be displayed.
The game ends when you either guess the word or run out of attempts.
